                                                                      Bootstrap Regression – Python

This project demonstrates the use of the bootstrap method in Python to assess the stability of regression models. It compares two types of models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor

The bootstrap method allows for: multiple resampling of training data with replacement, fitting multiple models to different samples, analyzing the variability of predictions and evaluating errors.

Features

- Generating synthetic regression data y = 2x + noise,
- Splitting data into training and testing sets,
- Repeatedly fitting models using the bootstrap method,
- Calculating the mean squared error (MSE) for each iteration,
- Analyzing the correlation between predictions of different models.
