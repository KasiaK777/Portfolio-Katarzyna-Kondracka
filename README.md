# Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository showcases my projects in Data Science and Machine Learning, including data analysis, visualization, 
and predictive modeling. Projects use diverse datasets—such as e-commerce, flights, and financial data—and demonstrate 
the ability to generate insights and build ML models from data cleaning to model evaluation.

Welcome to my portfolio! Here I present my analytical projects.


## 📌 Projects

- **[Project 01 BB84_Protocol](./Project_01_BB84_Protocol/)**  
Analysis and simulation of the quantum key distribution protocol BB84.

- **[Project 02 Energy_Consumption](./Project_02_Energy_Consumption/)**  
 Exploration of energy usage trends and predictive modeling.

- **[Project 03 Insurance_case](./Project_03_Insurance_case/)**  

      Comprehensive analysis of insurance claims data, including:
           ~ data cleaning and preprocessing,
           ~ exploration and visualization of claims structure,
           ~ feature engineering (e.g., age of vehicle, time from policy start),
           ~ handling missing data using categorical imputation strategies,
           ~ clustering of customers using K-Means,
           ~ correlation analysis and insights into claim patterns.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis: from raw CSV to well-prepared ML-ready dataset and segmentation.

- **[Project 04 Bootstrap](./Project_04_Bootstrap/)**  

Titanic_Logistic_Regression_Hyperparameter_Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning of a Logistic Regression model on the Titanic dataset, including:

   - One-hot encoding and data preprocessing
   - Splitting into train/test sets
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
   - Optimization of penalty and C with F1-score as the target metric
   - 8-fold cross-validation
   - Analysis and comparison of best hyperparameters from both methods
   
     Implementation of Bootstrap resampling for statistical estimation, including:
   - Estimation of confidence intervals for key statistics
   - Application to real datasets for robust inference
   - Visualization of Bootstrap distributions and results


- **[Project 05 GridSearch](./Project_05_GridSearch/)** 
- **[Project 06 Financial_Cash_Flow_model](./Project_06_Financial_Cash_Flow_model/)**
