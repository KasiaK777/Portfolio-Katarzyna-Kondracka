# Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository showcases my projects in Data Science and Machine Learning, including data analysis, visualization, 
and predictive modeling. Projects use diverse datasets—such as e-commerce, flights, and financial data—and demonstrate 
the ability to generate insights and build ML models from data cleaning to model evaluation.

Welcome to my portfolio! Here I present my analytical projects.
